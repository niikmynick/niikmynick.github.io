            <p>My name is Nikita</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was born in 2004 in Norilsk - a small city in Russia located above the Arctic Circle,
                where the average temperature is below freezing for most of the year.
                In late 2014, my family and I moved to Saint Petersburg, where I have lived ever since</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my youth, I was always fascinated by the world around me and the way things worked.
                To be more specific, I was interested in chemistry and biology, loved to read books and make various experiments.
                However, science was not the only thing that caught my attention.
                I was also passionate about magic tricks and illusions, especially those that involved playing cards.
                My interest in magic led me to learn cardistry, which is the art of card flourishing.
                To this day, I still enjoy practicing and performing cardistry moves</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2014, I discovered the world of puzzles and speedcubing, which became my main hobby for the next few years.
                In 2017, I started participating in competitions and became a member of the World Cube Association. Since then,
                I have competed in numerous competitions and have been able to achieve some decent results.
                In fact, one of these competitions was held in ITMO University, and when I saw the campus, I knew that I wanted to study there</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this period of my life, I also became interested in music and started learning FL Studio.
                My first tracks were simple loops, but over time I began to develop my own unique style and start using Ableton as my main DAW.
                In 2019, I released my first track called "Idem", and since then I have released several more tracks and albums.
                My music has received positive feedback from listeners and has been featured in various playlists</p>
            <br>
            <p>Also in this period, I became interested in design and started learning Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Figma.
                I started creating my own designs and logos, and even took on some freelance projects.
                My designs have been used by various clients and have received positive feedback</p>
            <br>
            <p>All of these interests and hobbies needed a way to be shared with the world, that's why niik was born.
                niik is a personal project that combines all of my interests and hobbies into one place, where I can share them with others.
                The project is constantly evolving and growing, and I am excited to see where it will go in the future</p>
            <br>
            <p>My journey in technology and programming began in 2018 when my friend asked me to help him with his game project.
                For this project, I made a simple graphical interface using my skills in design.
                After all, this project has not been completed, but it was like a starting point for me.
                Since then, I have learned several programming languages on my own and have worked on various projects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2022, I was graduating from school and had to choose a university and a major.
                After much thought, I decided to take computer science instead of chemistry on the Unified State Exam.
                Fortunately, I was able to pass the exam and enter the university of my dreams</p>
            <br>
            <p>Well, now I am a second-year student at ITMO University, pursuing a degree in neurotechnologies and programming,
                still writing music, solving puzzles, studying biomechanics and other interesting things in my free time</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here are some of my achievements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Winner in the "Development of a back-end solution for voice control of a car" track at the ATOM Hackathon</li>
