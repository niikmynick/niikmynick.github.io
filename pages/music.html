            <p>my name is Nikita</p>

            <br>

            <p>i am a second year student at ITMO University pursuing a degree in neurotechnologies and programming</p>
            <p>with my passion for building complex systems (for my level of experience, of course) and solving challenging problems
                i am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer</p>
