                <p>My name is Nikita</p>
                <p>I was born in 2004 in Norilsk - a small city in Russia located above the Arctic Circle,
                    where the average temperature is below freezing for most of the year.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>Early life and interests</h4>
                <p>In my youth, I was always fascinated by the world around me and the way things worked.
                    To be more specific, I was interested in chemistry and biology, loved to read books and make various experiments.
                    However, science was not the only thing that caught my attention.
                    I was also passionate about magic tricks and illusions, especially those that involved playing cards.
                    My interest in magic led me to learn cardistry, which is the art of card flourishing. </p>
                <p>Actually, to this day I still enjoy practicing and performing cardistry moves</p>
                <br />
                <h4>Moving to St. Petersburg</h4>
                <p>In late 2014, my family and I moved to Saint Petersburg, where I have lived ever since.
                    This move opened up new opportunities for me and allowed me to explore new interests and hobbies.</p>
                <p>Also in this period I discovered the world of puzzles and speedcubing, which became my main hobby for the next few years.</p>
                <p>In 2017, I started participating in competitions and became a member of the World Cube Association. Since then,
                    I have competed in numerous competitions and have been able to achieve some decent results.
                    In fact, one of these competitions was held in ITMO University, and when I saw the campus, I knew that I wanted to study there</p>
                <p>In this period of my life, I also became interested in music and started learning FL Studio.
                    My first tracks were simple loops, but over time I began to develop my own unique style and start using Ableton as my main DAW.
                    In 2019, I released my first track called "Idem", and since then I have released several more tracks and albums.
                    My music has received positive feedback from listeners and has been featured in various playlists</p>
                <br />
                <p>Also in this period, I became interested in design and started learning Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Figma.
                    I started creating my own designs and logos, and even took on some freelance projects.
                    My designs have been used by various clients and have received positive feedback</p>
                <br />
                <p>All of these interests and hobbies needed a way to be shared with the world, that's why niik was born.
                    niik is a personal project that combines all of my interests and hobbies into one place, where I can share them with others.
                    The project is constantly evolving and growing, and I am excited to see where it will go in the future</p>
                <br />
                <p>My journey in technology and programming began in 2018 when my friend asked me to help him with his game project.
                    For this project, I made a simple graphical interface using my skills in design.
                    After all, this project has not been completed, but it was like a starting point for me.
                    Since then, I have learned several programming languages on my own and have worked on various projects.</p>
                <br />
                <p>In 2022, I was graduating from school and had to choose a university and a major.
                    After much thought, I decided to take computer science instead of chemistry on the Unified State Exam.
                    Fortunately, I was able to pass the exam and enter the university of my dreams</p>
                <br />
                <p>Well, now I am a second-year student at ITMO University, pursuing a degree in neurotechnologies and programming,
                    still writing music, solving puzzles, studying biomechanics and other interesting things in my free time</p>
                <br />
